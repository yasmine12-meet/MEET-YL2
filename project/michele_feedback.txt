Thanks for sending two versions of an app. However, the “backup” app was way too simple ;). Your alarm clock app had a problem, but I think the error is not such a difficult error to fix. Did you ever get a chance to test the app at home? You were using a different version of AppInventor than everyone else was - the version of AppInventor changed while you guys were working on the projects, and I said to you guys that you should use the older version because those were the ones you learned in the tutorial. In terms of real life, it is not a problem that you used the wrong version of AppInventor, but in terms of following instructions, you didn’t use the right version. 

The error I get when I open your app is “ “GetMillis” cannot accept argument *empty string* “. What this implies to me is that you are trying to set the argument of GetMillis somewhere with a variable that you do not initialize to a non-empty string. Looking at your screenshots, I see that there are two times that you are using GetMillis - once you are setting it to the time Now and once you are setting it from a global variable. Most likely, this global variable is the problem. So when I look at the initializing of the global, I see that it is initialized to an empty string. It looks like you understood what the fundamental problem is with the app, since I see that when the button is clicked, you are setting this global variable to Now. This is exactly what you need to be doing - but you put it in the wrong place. Because the error pops up immediately when I open the app, you need to set this global variable not when you click the button, but in the screen OnLoad part of the app. 

The design looks clean and easy to use, so good job with that. It is unfortunate that this simple bug basically makes the app unusable. It is a very easy to fix, if you want to take a small amount of time to fix it and get the app working just like you want.
